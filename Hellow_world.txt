Difference between Partitions and Zorder in Databricks:
Partitions : Partitions are used on columns in cases where a column is frequently used in "WHERE" condition of a SQL query and has low cardinility. 
Zorder: Zorder organizes the efficiently so that related records are stored together based on a clolumn. Zorder is efficient when a high cardinal column is used in where condition of a SQL query. 
Zorder can have list of columns seperated by commas. 
Partition and zorder cannot be declared on the same set of columns
If we use liquid clustering, We need not use partitions and zorder.
We can also enable liquid cluster.
